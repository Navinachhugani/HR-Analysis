## HR-Analysis

# Introduction:
The Project aims to leverage data analysis to optimize HR/Talent Acquisition teams at Organization. It analyses candidate performance and attrition data over six months to evaluate success rates, identify factors affecting performance, improve recruitment strategies, and increase overall productivity.

# Data Overview:
The data set comprises candidate attributes such as gender, previous work experience, education qualification, career gap, source of resume, and performance status for six months.

# Data Exploration:
Exploratory Data Analysis revealed the distribution and characteristics of data.
Key findings include:
- Gender distribution: Majority of candidates were female.
- Variability in performance rating across different attributes.
- Identification of missing values, outliers.

# Performance Analysis:
Analysed performance ratings of candidates over six-month period.
Insights include:
- Variations in performance based on gender, previous experience, career gap and education qualification.
- Visualizations of performance trends using column charts, donut chart, cards, slicers, bookmarks, and matrix table.

# Attrition Analysis:
Investigated attrition rates and analysed the performance level of existing candidates. This helped to identify potential correlations between performance and attrition. There were fluctuations in attrition rates over time.

# Insights:
- Insights gained from the analysis include:
- There were fluctuations in attrition rate over 6 months.
- The attrition rate ranges from 41.66% in the 1-2 months to around 10-13% in subsequent months.
- In the 4th, 5th, and 6th month, a significant number of exiting candidate were either average or below average performers.
- These findings suggest a potential correlation between performance and attrition with lower-performing candidates more likely to quit/exit.
- Additionally, attrition rates tended to decrease over time, indicating potential adjustments or improvements in the program.
- Females tend to have a higher representation among existing candidates, as well as those from IT and Non-IT backgrounds, also varies.

# Recommendations:
Based on insights obtained, the following recommendations are proposed:
- Implement targeted retention strategies focusing on improving candidate performance.
- Provide career development opportunities to enhance employee engagement and retention.
- Conduct exit interviews to gain deeper insight into reasons for leaving.
- Enhance the onboarding process and provide clear expectations to candidates from the beginning of the training program to mitigate early retention. Also, to ensure alignment with organizational culture and values.
- Conduct weekly performance assessments and provide additional support or resources to candidates who may be at risk of leaving.
- Do weekly one-on-one for clear understanding.

# Conclusion:
The analysis of performance evaluation, exit data and attrition rates reveals fluctuations in candidate retention and varying performance levels, highlighting the need for targeted interventions and continuous monitoring. By implementing proactive measure to support at-risk candidates and adapting strategies based on performance and attrition trends, Organization can enhance the effectiveness of its training program and achieve better outcomes for candidates and the organization.
